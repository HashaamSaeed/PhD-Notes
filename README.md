# Research-Paper-Notes
Some of the notes on seminal papers, concepts, math, meetings, observations i took during my PhD.

These are PDFs that contain hand written personal notes covering topics in Computer Graphics, Differentiable Rendering, Deep-Learning and Robntics.


P.S If you can actually decipher my handwriting, Kudos to you buddy !! LOL
